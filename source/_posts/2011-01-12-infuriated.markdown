title: This Modi-mania infuriates me
---

It looks like even media editors are in thrall of Modi's propaganda machine. [This tweet](http://twitter.com/#!/sardesairajdeep/status/25111169043800064) from Rajdeep Sardesai really infuriated me (and the one before that). If me and my little outfit count as "industry" (they better) then heck no, we don't condone what Modi did, it's a damn shame that a mass-murderer is even power in the first place. 

And people like Sardesai seem to be condoning this. Where is the effing outrage, dude? For shame, Rajdeep. For shame.
