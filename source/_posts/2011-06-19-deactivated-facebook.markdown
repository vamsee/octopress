Finally deactivated my Facebook account. I think I still need sometime to completely shut it down, as I'm still in two minds about Facebook as customer outreach platform (for products) and events platform. 

But I've also noticed that it is killing my desire to write, instead posting something very short in the form of tweets, or at best comments. There's only so much you can express yourself in 140 chars. I need more :)

Looks like I'm writing only every 6 months or so now, which needs to be improved on. Since I don't have the easy way out like I did with Fb earlier, I think I'll be a bit less lazier and post more often here. I will continue to post the more simpler stuff on Twitter, though. That is one communications platform that I haven't gotten tired of :)
