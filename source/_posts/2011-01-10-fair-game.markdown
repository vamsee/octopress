Watched [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977855/) movie today. It deserves every bit of it's 7.0 rating, probably more. I read some fairly ho-hum reviews about this movie, so wasn't expecting a lot, but what a powerhouse movie. Admittedly, part of the reason I went to the movie because Naomi Watts is in the movie (I totally loved her in 21 Grams) and she didn't disappoint this time either. She carries the movie with grace, and Sean Penn does a great job too. Whatever I expected from this movie, I didn't expect to have a lump in my throat a couple of times. Yes, that good. And yes, you should watch this movie. Over n out.
