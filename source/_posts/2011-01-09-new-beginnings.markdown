I've been neglecting writing for way too long. Though hardly anybody reads this (lately I've seen a jump in subscribers, but I'm guessing that is purely curiosity rather than anything else). I'm not the one to complain though. I believe we write blogs for ourselves more than anyone else. But if you like it, that's great :)

I am fully to blame for this blog becoming just a way to share the zillions of cool stuff I find on the 'net - but I guess there are other ways of sharing it - <http://clips.vamsee.in> should still work, so that would be a good place to check out if you're interested in funky videos and other interesting things that catch my attention. I might mention them here occasionally anyway :).

So I'll try to keep this blog writing-only (mostly). I'm not sure how long this stint will last, but I feel the pull these days. Throw in a comment or two occasionally if you like :)
