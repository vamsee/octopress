It's not often that I write a deeply personal post. Perhaps I used to, a few years ago, but things are different now. I'm writing this sitting on a train on my way back to Bangalore from home. Recently my dad retired, and my whole family moved back to my native place, Yanam. This was where my dad was born, and we have tons of relatives and basically the whole town is a like an extended family. 

As it happens, I spent a lot of my growing up years here, attending a residential school though my ggrandparents' house is hardly a mile away. But no regrets though, I think the school I attended through those years made a big part of what I am today. I stayed in the same town and finished my Intermediate (+2) where I made some dear friends who I still meet whenever I go there. 

Now that my family moved back to Yanam, it really feels like "home" now. I've never been particularly good at academics, and this was an unending source of frustration to my dad. Also, I never really liked Math. I still don't like the subject, but I cope with it. I guess he feared I would end up a wastrel and an embarrassment. I don't know. But I survived, and I guess I'm not a hopeless case (yet?) :). But my dad and I always had arguments, fights, what not. I distintly remember myself combusting with anger within days of my dad visiting me at school or grandparents' house. 

My mom has been this patient bulwark against which the spoilt son can rely on for support.
